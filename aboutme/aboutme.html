    <p>Let me introduce myself! I'm from Quito Ecuador and I'm 23. My Major is Graphic Design with emphasis in UX/UI Design and I'm also doing a minor in Web Design. I served my mission in Florianopolis Brasil and because of that I speak Spanish, English and Portuguese. I love to go hiking to write, dance and travel. I'm a Junior but this is the first class I'm taking of my Minor and I'm really exited about it. </p>
    <p>There is 6 people in my family. My parents and I have 3 brothers, two olders and one youngest. I also have 3 dogs at home which I miss so much..Currently I work on campus and I really like my job. Also, something that I love about BYUI is to be sorrounded of people with my same values. </p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my web page. See you in class!</p>
